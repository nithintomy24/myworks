Install Procol Buffer 2.5.0(no other version)
  Protocol buffer is a serialization format developed by Google. It is Interface driven and is useful for applications that communicate over the wire. Below are the steps for protocol buffer installation.

  Download protocol buffer. Protocol buffer libs can be downloaded here. Download protocol buffer.
  https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases?after=v3.0.0-alpha-4.1
  Check if g++ compiler is installed on box. Protocol buffer needs g++ compiler to be present on your box before it can be built. This is a crisp post on how to install g++ compiler on your box. Install g++ compiler.
  Extract the protocol buffer archive and switch to the extracted directory.
  Inside the extracted directory hit the below commands to install protocol buffer. These may take a while, kindly be patient.
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  sudo make install
  protoc --version
  That's it. Protocol buffer version 2.5.0 is installed on your box.
  Note: Sometimes the latest version of protocol version does not load up. So we can do it manually by this command
  sudo ldconfig
  protoc --version
  
Install CMake
  CMake mostly will be already installed
  
python
  already installed
  
  apt-get -y install maven build-essential autoconf automake libtool cmake zlib1g-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libfuse-dev
  
  $ mvn install -DskipTests

  $ mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true
  Now your project is Eclipse ready.

  1.File -> Import...

  2.Choose "Existing Projects into Workspace".

  3.Select hadoop src folder as root 4. Click "Finish"
  
  Note: 
    if error message "cannot execute zip" search for the jar file in <http://search.maven.org> and place it in /.m2/<path>

     mvn clean
     mvn compile -Pnative
     mvn package
     mvn compile findbugs:findbugs
     mvn install
     mvn package -Pdist,docs,src,native -Dtar
  
[https://pravinchavan.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/building-apache-hadoop-from-source/]
  To Get Build
  mvn package -Pdist -Pdoc -Psrc -Dtar -DskipTests

It will build package and resulting distribuition is stored in-

hadoop-dist/target/ directory

Now can install this distribution and run job over it.

Some Alternatives ways of Building distributions:

Create binary distribution without native code and without documentation:

# mvn package -Pdist -DskipTests -Dtar
Create binary distribution with native code and with documentation:

# mvn package -Pdist,native,docs -DskipTests -Dtar
Create source distribution:

# mvn package -Psrc -DskipTests
Create source and binary distributions with native code and documentation:

# mvn package -Pdist,native,docs,src -DskipTests -Dtar
Create a local staging version of the website (in /tmp/hadoop-site)

# mvn clean site; mvn site:stage -DstagingDirectory=/tmp/hadoop-site
